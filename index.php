                   <h2>Patreon</h2>
                   <p>Sadly, running a server is not free. Previously we accepted donations to keep that server running. Now we've set up a Patreon for that purpose. It also allows us to provide various cosmetic bonuses as a way of thanking our patrons.</p><p>You can find out more about the patron tiers on our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ParadiseStation">Patreon</a> page!</p>
